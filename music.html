Money rains from the sky above
But keep the change 'cause I've got enough
A little time and some tenderness
You'll never buy my love
No other thing that's as precious to
No other! There's no other!
And a heart that's real and a heart that's true
Somethin' that you've got to know this girl
Wooh!
Take my hand
Or take over
Take my hand you
Or take over
Take my hand you
Or take over
Take my hand
Or take over
These presents don't really come for free
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me
Just take my hand and hold me tight
You'll never buy my love!
You buy me this and you buy me that
To win over! Win me over!
You got me wrong and that's a fact
Somethin' that you've got to notice
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
It's a shame but I've got to go
Wooh!
Take my hand
Or take over
Take my hand you
Or take over
Take my hand you
Or take over
Take my hand
Or take over
