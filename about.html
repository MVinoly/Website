        <p>I started my professional career in the trades, which I found very rewarding. Getting to step back and say, "I built that.", filled me with a lot of pride. As the pandemic progressed I found there was less and less work out there. Needing to support my family in another way, my wife suggested I take the time to go back to school and persue a passion I have always wanted to be a part of, "technology". I took a college level Full Stack Developer course and found it very challenging and exciting. As I have been progressing as a programmer/developer, I have found that feeling of, "I built that" again, with every app and website I develop. I am constantly looking to improve my ability to code and design, an endeavor I frankly could spend a lifetime doing and I couldn't be happier. Thank you for taking the time to get to know a little about me!</p>
